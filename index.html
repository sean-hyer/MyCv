        <p>
            I currently work as a cook, and I really do enjoy the job. It's taxing but rewarding. But I'm looking for a career change. <br>
            I never finished my degree (as it was interrupted by a hospital stay), but I have a good technical background. I was priveleged to attend both the best public school and the best technical university in England. <br>
            Aiming for IT might seem like a pretty big jump, but most of my family are programmers, and my father has been teaching us since we were small. <br>
            Additionally, as an expecting father, a better job seems like an important goal. I hope you will take me into consideration. <br>
